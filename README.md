### Who should use this?
Anyone 

### Using:
```
1. Run bot in bot/dist

2. Enter Facebook's login Email and Password 
   (Don't worry about losing your facebook account, I'm not that good yet :D)
   
3. Enter the message you want to send in the Message field (Message sent by bot will be 'Auto message: *your message*') 
   If you left it blank,  message will be 'Auto message:'
   
4. Enter facebook's sticker id if you want to send a sticker 
   (sticker's id can be found at http://autofb.net/tools/lay_id_sticker/)
   (if you left it blank, bot will not send any sticker)
   
5. Click 'Login & Run' button or just press 'Enter' to run it. 
   If the interface, you are now running auto_Reply bot
   If the login has any problem, you can see the problem on Terminal
